<p>
A transition represents a condition for changing from one state to another.
The transition is enabled when the preceding step, i.e. the step connected to the <b>input port</b>, is active.
If there is no preceding step, the transition is always enabled.
The transition fires if it is enabled and its associated <b>condition</b> is true.
When the transition fires it deactivates the preceding step and activates
the succeeding step, i.e. the step connected to the <b>output port</b>.
</p>

<p>
Transitions can also have a <b>priority</b>.
A lower number means a higher priority, with priority 1 being the highest possible priority.
No specified priority means the lowest possible priority.
Fireable higher priority transitions inhibit transitions for alternative paths from firing.
</p>

<p>
The condition text can be shown (default) or hidden.
When the condition is hidden it is shown as a tool-tip text.
</p>

<p>
During execution the truth-value of the condition of the
transition is indicated using colors. A true condition is indicated
by a green transition. A false condition is indicated by a red transition.
If the condition of a transition is changed to <tt>0</tt> or <tt>1</tt> during execution,
it is applied directly.
</p>

<h4>Text Methods</h4>

<p>
Transitions currently have no name and thus there is no way to
reference them. Hence transitions have no text methods.
This is subject to change in future releases.
