<h1>Language Overview - Procedures</h1>

<hr>

<p>
<b>Procedures</b> make it possible to create reusable building blocks.
A procedure has its body stored in a subworkspace and begin and end with
enter and exit steps in the same way as for macro steps.
</p>

<p>
Procedures are reentrant and may even be recursive. Procedures may also have parameters.
All internal variables within the procedure can be used as parameters.
</p>

<p>
A procedure can be called in the following ways:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Through a <a href="LangRef_FC_ProcedureStep.html">Procedure Step</a>.</li>
	<li>Through a <a href="LangRef_FC_ProcessStep.html">Process Step</a>.</li>
	<li>With a call to the <tt>spawn()</tt> method.</li>
	<li>Manually from the Procedure object.</li>
</ul>

<p>
When a procedure is called from a procedure step, the transitions after
the procedure step do not become enabled until the execution has reached
the exit step of the procedure. This corresponds to an ordinary
procedure call.
</p>

<p>
When a procedure is called from a process step the transitions
after the procedure step are enabled immediately.
Conceptually, the procedure call is spawned and executed in a separate execution thread.
</p>

<p>
When a procedure is started manually or with the <tt>spawn()</tt> method it is started in
the same way as for a Process Step.
