<h1>Language Overview - Steps and Transitions</h1>

<hr>

<p>
The graphical language of Grafchart is based on Grafcet/Sequential Function
Charts (SFC). The language is state-transition oriented. A Grafchart
program consists of a function chart that represents an activity flow.
By convention the flow goes from the top of page to the bottom of page.
</p>

<p>
More formally a Grafcet function chart is a bipartite directed graph consisting
of <b>steps</b> and <b>transitions</b>.
</p>

<p>
A step can either be <i>active</i> or <i>inactive</i>.
An <i>active</i> step is indicated by a filled token.
</p>

<p>
Associated with the steps are actions. The actions
are expressed in a textual action language. Actions can be performed when
the step is activated, deactivated, aborted and/or periodically while the
step is active.
</p>

<p>
The transitions have an associated boolean <i>condition</i> that acts as a guard.
A transition is <i>enabled</i> if all immediately preceding steps are <i>active</i>.
An <i>enabled</i> transition <i>fires</i> if its <i>condition</i> is true.
