<h1>Language Overview - Scoping Rules</h1>

<hr>

<p>
JGrafchart uses lexical name scoping based on workspaces. A variable or object reference can
be either <b>global</b> or <b>local</b>. <a name="globalReference"></a>
A global reference starts with the application name and then uses dot-notation to access
lower lexical layers. For example, the reference <tt>W1.M1.V1</tt>
could refer to a variable named V1 contained in the macro step M1 that
in turn is found in the top-level workspace of the application named W1. A local reference is
local to the lexical context in which the reference is declared. For
example, a reference to V1 from a step action of a step located at the
same workspace as V1 is simply written as "V1". During symbol lookup
the search begins at the lexical context of the expression. If a matching
object is found, the lookup is completed, If not, the search continues
at the next higher lexical level, in this example the top-level workspace of
the application named W1. The effect of this is that names on a lower lexical level hide the same
names on higher lexical levels, in the same way as in ordinary lexically
scoped programming languages. It is also possible to use dot-notation to
reference the internal parts of object groups.

<p>
All objects share the same namespace, i.e. looking up a reference simply
returns the <i>first</i> object with the correct name.
