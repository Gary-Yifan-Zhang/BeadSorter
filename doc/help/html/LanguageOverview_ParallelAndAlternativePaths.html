<h1>Language Overview - Parallel and Alternative Paths</h1>

<hr>

<p>
In Grafchart it is possible to express <b>parallel and alternative paths</b>.
</p>

<p><img src="Figures/altpar.gif" alt="Parallel and Alternative Paths"></p>

<p>
There is no path or condition analysis in JGrafchart. Hence you must manually check
that the conditions for alternative paths are mutually exclusive and that
parallel paths are joined properly.
</p>

<p>
A convenient way to ensure mutual exclusion is to specify transition priorities.
Transitions with higher priority (lower number) will inhibit transitions
for alternative paths from firing.
