<h1>Language Reference - XML: CHEM and CCOM</h1>

<hr>

<p>
JGrafchart has been developed within the EU/GROWTH FP5 project
CHEM - Advanced Decision Systems for the Chemical/Petrochemical Manufacturing
Industries. Within CHEM a large number of operator support toolboxes
for different tasks (e.g., alarm analysis, fault detection, diagnosis,
planning) are being developed. The toolboxes are implemented in different
languages and run on different platforms. They are integrated through
the CCOM infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
CCOM (Chem Communications Manager) allows toolboxes to communicate
using message passing. It is based on the message-oriented middleware
xmlBlaster. The messages are represented by XML structures. CCOM supports
publish/subscribe and point-to-point communication. The messages can
be of different type, e.g., data messages, event messages, RPC invocation
messages, and RPC response messages. The CHEM information model establishes
a common syntax for data messages.
