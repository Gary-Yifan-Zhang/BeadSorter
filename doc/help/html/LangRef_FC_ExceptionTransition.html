<p>
An exception transitions is a special transition that may only be connected to an exception output port.
When the exception transition is fired the preceding step is aborted and the applicable abort actions are executed.
Exception transitions always have priority over ordinary transitions.
When connected to a macro step it is possible to refer to the internal state of the macro step from the condition, e.g.
it is possible to express that an exception only may be fired if the macro step is in a certain internal state.
The connection rules for the output port are the same as for ordinary transitions.
