<h1>Language Reference - XML - Receiving Reply Messages</h1>

<hr>

<p>
In many situations it is necessary to be able to match an incoming
reply message with the original data request message. This can be done
with the help of the <tt>getSendHandle()</tt> method of the XML Message
Out object. The method returns the handle that was associated with the
message being sent by CCOM. This handle will be a part of the reply message
and can be used to detect the correct reply message (the one that
corresponds to the data request message).
</p>

<h3>Example: Receiving a Reply Message</h3>

<p>
An example of how a reply message can be replied and identified
is shown below:

<p>
The DataReply message will only be decoded if it matches the DataMess
message being sent.
