<h1>Language Reference - XML - RPC Libraries</h1>

<hr>

<p>
RPC libraries with proxy procedures for the different CCOM components
can be found in the grafchart/CCOM folder. To use them you need to load
them and compile them. The procedures can then be called from ordinary
procedure steps.
</p>

<p>
Currently the only libraries supported are the DTM Library and
the Generic RTM Library.
