<p>
A process step is a version of a procedure step
where the call to the procedure is started as a separate execution
thread. The transition connected at the output port is enabled
immediately when the procedure has been started. It is possible to
have several executing procedure calls emanating from the same process
step. When the execution within a procedure call reaches the exit step
the procedure call is terminated without executing any actions of the
exit step. Process steps have no exception output ports.
