In every scan the following operations are performed:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Read digital and analog inputs.</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Each transition that is enabled and has a condition that is true, is marked for firing.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			If a transition marked for firing has lower priority than an alternative transition which is also marked for firing, its firing mark is removed.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			The transitions marked for firing perform the following operations:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Each step preceding the transition is deactivated, i.e. the exit actions of these steps are executed.
			</li>
			<li>
				Each step succeeding the transition is activated, i.e. the enter actions of these steps are executed.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			The following operations are performed for each step:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The step timer (accessed through &lt;stepname&gt;.t or &lt;stepname&gt;.s) is updated.
			</li>
			<li>
				If the step is active and was also active the previous scan, the periodic actions of the step are executed.
			</li>
			<li>
				The variables related to the normal actions of the step are marked if the step's activation status has changed since the previous scan.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Update variables that are marked due to normal actions.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Sleep until the start of the next scan cycle.
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
This evaluation strategy makes the evaluation order of the transitions irrelevant and eliminates the risk of firing chains of transitions within the same scan-cycle.
It also affects how alternative transitions with non-mutually exclusive conditions are handled.
In JGrafchart all the alternative transitions will be fired. This conforms to the Grafcet standard and also gives a fully deterministic behavior.
You need to make sure that alternative transitions always are mutually exclusive, e.g. by using priorities.
