<h1>Language Overview - Types and Variables</h1>

<hr>

<p>
JGrafchart supports four primitive data types: <b>boolean</b>, <b>integer</b>, <b>real</b>, and
<b>string</b>. All primitive data types exist as ordinary variables, inputs, and outputs.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Variables receive their values from the application.
		Normally they can be both read from and written to but they can
		also be configured as constants to prevent writing.
	</li>
	<li>
		Inputs receive their values from the external environment.
		They can be connected to I/O cards, input sockets, etc.
		Inputs can be read from but not written to from the application.
	</li>
	<li>
		Outputs receive their values from the
		application and transmit these values to the external environment.
		They can be connected to I/O cards, output sockets, etc.
		Outputs are normally only written to but reading is also allowed.
	</li>
</ul>
