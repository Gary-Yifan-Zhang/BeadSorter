<h1>Language Reference - FC - Step Fusion Set</h1>

<hr>

<p><img src="Figures/stepfusionset.gif" alt="Icon" style="float: right;"></p>

<p>
A step fusion set makes it possible to have steps with multiple
views. Each step that belongs to a step fusion set constitutes one
view of the same conceptual step. When one of the steps in the set become
active, all the steps in the set are activated, and when one of the
steps is deactivated, all are deactivated. The steps that should belong
to the same set are specified by <b>Text</b> objects on the subworkspace
of the step fusion set. <a href="LanguageOverview_ScopingRules.html#globalReference">Global references</a> must be used.
Step fusion sets may contain steps, macro steps, and procedure steps.
Neither the step fusion set itself nor any of its views may be contained
within a procedure. In principle it should be possible for a step to
be a member of multiple step fusion sets, although this has not been
tested.
</p>

<p>A step fusion set may be non-abortive or abortive.</p>

<h3>Non-abortive step fusion sets:</h3>
<p>In a non-abortive fusion set, all the transitions connected
to the output of any of the step fusion set views must be enabled
in order for one of the transitions to be enabled. When an enabled transition
is fired, all the steps in the set are deactivated and their exit actions
are executed. The different steps of a non-abortive fusion set behave
as if they all are connected in parallel.
</p>

<h3>Abortive step fusion sets:</h3>
<p>
In an abortive fusion set, a transition connected to the
output of one of the steps in the set is enabled independently
of the status of the other steps in the set. When an enabled transition
is fired, the step connected to the transition is terminated in the
normal way and its exit actions are executed. The other steps in the
fusion set are aborted and their abortive actions are executed.
