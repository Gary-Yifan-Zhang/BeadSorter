<h1>Editor - Workspaces</h1>

<hr>

<p>
Workspaces are windows within the workspace area of the editor.
The window title of a workspace is its <a href="LanguageOverview_ScopingRules.html#globalReference">global reference</a> name.
Top-level workspaces have the name prefixed by "<b>Top:</b>".
</p>

<p>
Workspaces have an associated level number.
Workspaces with a high level number are always shown on top of workspaces with a lower level number.
When a workspace receives focus it is shown on top of all workspaces with the same or lower level number.
The level of a top-level workspace is 1. The level a subworkspaces is the level of its parent workspace + 1.
</p>

<p>
By default each workspace has a grid and objets that are created or moved will
automatically snap to the grid. Connectable objects are snapped so that their
connection stub is horizontally aligned with the grid.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to lock all workspaces of an application. A locked workspace cannot
be resized and it is not possible to move, delete, or create objects, make connections etc.
However, it is still possible to access object-specific menus and it is still
possible to execute the application. A locked workspace is indicated by a
lock icon <img src="Figures/icon-lock2.gif" alt="Locked Workspace">.
Locked workspace can for example be used to
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		restrict the operations that an end-user can perform on the application.
	</li>
	<li>
		create libraries from which you can drag-and-drop objects in the same way as from the palette.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
A workspace that is executing is indicated by an arrow icon
<img src="Figures/runner5.jpeg" alt="Running Workspace">.
The arrow icon overrides the lock icon.
</p>

<p>
Hold the shift key while scrolling with the mouse to scroll horizontally. The scrollbars of a workspace may be removed.

<h2><a name="Inspector"></a>Inspector</h2>


<p>
	The inspector is a window that can be opened for hierarchical objects, i.e. objects containing a workspace.
	The window contains a table with all analog and digital inputs
	and outputs, hierarchical objects, and ordinary variables found on the workspace.
	The values in the table are automatically updated.
	Double-click on the value of a variable to edit it.
	This is, however, not possible if the application is locked.
	Double-click on a hierarchical object to make the inspector show this object instead.
