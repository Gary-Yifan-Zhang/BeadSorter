<h1>Language Overview - Execution</h1>

<hr>

<p>
A function chart cannot be executed until it has been successfully compiled.
Compilation errors and warnings are shown in the message list.
During execution, parts of the editing is disabled and several things do not
take effect until the application has been re-compiled and restarted.
</p>

<p>
It is recommended to run JGrafchart with a visible terminal since most 
runtime errors as well as most other problems are printed there.
</p>

<p>
JGrafchart uses the traditional PLC execution model.
A separate periodic thread executes each application.
Every period (scan-cycle) the thread performs the operations:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Read digital and analog inputs</li>
	<li>Execute one scan of the application.</li>
	<li>Update variables subject to normal actions.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Each time an output is assigned in the application it immediately affects the real IO.
