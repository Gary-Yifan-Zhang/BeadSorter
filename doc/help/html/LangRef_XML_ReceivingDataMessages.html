<h1>Language Reference - XML - Receiving Data Messages</h1>

<hr>

<p>
All XML Messages are received using XML Message In objects.
An XML Message In object will receive an XML Message if the application
is executing and the identifier of the XML Message In object is equal
to the main tag name of the message. (If the identifier has no value
the local name of the XML Message In is used instead). A special case
exists for messages with the main tag name ChemContentMessage. If these
messages contain a Subject element they will only be received in an XML
Message In object if the value of the subject attribute of the XML Message
In is equal to the value of the Subject element.
</p>

<p>
Multiple XML Message In objects may (and most likely will) receive
the same message. When an XML Message In object is received two things
occur:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		All variables inside the XML Message In object are initialised
		to their initial values (if they have any initial values).
	</li>
	<li>
		The XML structure in the message is decoded (using the DOM
		XML parser) and mapped to the corresponding element/attribute variables
		within the XML Message In object. The mapping is done according to best
		effort. This means that elements in the message for which there are
		no corresponding element/attribute variables are ignored. It also means
		that element/attribute variables for which there are no corresponding
		XML elements/attributes will not be assigned any new value. The initialisation
		of all variables is used to be able to detect if a variable really has
		been assigned a new value from the message.
	</li>
</ol>
