<h1>Language Reference - XML - Subscriptions</h1>

<hr>

<p>
In order to receive messages that published under a certain topic
the toolbox must first have subscribed to the topic. Subscription and
unsubscription can be made in two different ways:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Implicit subscription</p>
		<p>
			When the application is started an automatic subscription is made
			to the topics of all the XML Message In objects of the application. Similarly,
			when the application is stopped an automatic unsubscription is made to
			the topics of all the XML Message Out objects in the application. Implicit
			subscription is always activated.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Explicit subscription.</p>
		<p>
			A topic is subscribed to using the function <tt>subscribe(aTopic)</tt>.
			Similarly a topic is unsubscribed to using the function <tt>unsubscribe(aTopic)</tt>.
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>
