<h1>Editor - Mouse Interaction</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Select</h2>

<p>
Selection works as usual, i.e. click on an object to select it, multi-select
by click-dragging and include/exclude an object from the selection by
pressing the Shift or Ctrl key while clicking
</p>

<h3>Move</h3>

<p>
Moving of a selection works as usual. Approaching the workspace borders will
conveniently scroll the workspace.
</p>

<p>
Pressing the Ctrl key during a move or moving the selection to another workspace
will instead create a copy of the selection.
</p>

<h3>Resize</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
		When an object is selected it is highlighted by showing its resize handles.
		These can be used to resize the object.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Object Context Menu</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
		Double-click or right-click on an object to show its context menu.
	</li>
